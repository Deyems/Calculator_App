It was established in 2014 by a geologist, a graduate of University Ibadan, Nigeria and with a vision to improve water borehole industry. All the equipment used in the execution of projects at Dayspring are modern, which include Rotary Drilling Rigs and Elgi Compressors. These clearly put us ahead of the competition in the drilling industry. Drilling method adopted is either Down The Hole (DTH) drilling method or mud drilling, depending on the terrain to be drilled (basement complex or sedimentary).
